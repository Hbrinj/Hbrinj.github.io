NOTE: Don't do this if you are not sure about the validity and trustworthiness of the website you are visiting.

`thisisunsafe` is all you need to bypass `NET::ERR_CERT_INVALID` exceptions when you come across them in Chrome. Click anywhere on the page and enter that key phrase, but do so at your own risk.
