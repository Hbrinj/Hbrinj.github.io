I've been working on a project which is going to be focusing on using SwiftUI in its entirety. The project is pretty straight forward in that there are numerous applications on the app store that provide a solution to this problem. It is a resource tracker that generates a QR code which can be used to identify one or more assets. Resources can also be grouped into boxes. The app is meant to do one thing and do it well. The full repo can be found here: [trackit](https://github.com/Hbrinj/trackit-ios).

P.S.
Don't judge me on my commits, it'll become cleaner as I understand more of the iOS fundamentals

P.P.S.
TDD has also gone out of the window with this while I'm learning. Promise
